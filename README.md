Starter kit for automated browser testing of external sites using [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

## Usage

Add your tests, install dependencies and run tests

```bash
yarn install
npm test
```

Docker example for your site `https://mysite:8080`, mounting tests `./spec` and screenshot directory

```bash
docker run --rm -e APP_URL=https://mysite:8080\
 -v ./spec:/app/tests\
 -v ./screenshots:/app/screenshots\
awesomeinc/puppeteer-mocha:latest
```

Or the same with `docker-compose`

```bash
docker-compose run --rm test
```

  Much more advanced than this repo. Seems to be directed towards self-testing node/exprees sites with lasso and markojs. If this suits you we definitely recommend `mocha-puppeteer`. However, we wanted to simply express browser tests using mocha for any external site (e.g. a rails app). Since we could not find an option to test external sites or to test other apps than express/markojs-based, we rolled our own.
